# Purify SEngine


## Description:

Purify SEngine is a Google Chrome extension that removes AI overviews from search results and/or sets the default search tab, to display 'web' as its parameter (&udp=14); it does so automatically with the switch of a button.

## To do/add:
* Upload in Chrome Webstore (In progress)
* Change the placeholder icon to something better :D
